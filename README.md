# Expense Tracker CLI

A simple expense tracker application to manage your finances. The application should allow users to add, delete, and view their expenses. The application should also provide a summary of the expenses

Application runs from the command line and have the following features:

- Users can add an expense with a description and amount.
- Users can update an expense.
- Users can delete an expense.
- Users can view all expenses.

Here are some additional features to implement:

- Add expense categories and allow users to filter expenses by category.
- Allow users to set a budget for each month and show a warning when the user exceeds the budget.
